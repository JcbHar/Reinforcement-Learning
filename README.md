# **Reinforcement Learning**

This repository contains implementations of different reinforcement learning methods, including:

- **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** – A method for handling continuous action spaces, balancing exploration and exploitation.
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** – Uses a neural network to approximate Q-values and improve decision-making.
- **Q-Learning** – A simple approach that updates values based on rewards to find the best actions.

To run the algorithm use the notebook in each algorithm folder.
